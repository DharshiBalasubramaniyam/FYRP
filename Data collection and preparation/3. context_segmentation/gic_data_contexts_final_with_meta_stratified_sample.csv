1-16-1421-1,Objectives of the Research Cell for TVET Promotion,"The Research Cell will continue work towards achievement of following three objectives.

Objective 01

To foster conducting and promotion of research related to TVET  issues.

It is observed that many researches are done in education and higher education sector. However, a very few or minimum number of researches are done in TVET sector. Therefore, it is vital to foster conducting and promotion of research related to TVET through inculcation or research culture in the TVET sector of Sri Lanka. Due to the low prominence given to research, the officers of training institutions undertake no research or engage in TVET research at low level. The research will conduct in a way that proposes recommendations for strengthening policy and planning of TVET. Therefore, it is timely to engage in TVET research activities at institute level and national level.

Objective 02

To be the key partner of facilitation for TVET research.

The Research Cell will facilitate undertaking research through dissemination of TVET information among interested parties, especially among TVET researchers. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce mechanisms to disseminate research information in the TVET sector.

Objective 03

To create beneficial linkages with local and international research Institutes.

One important strategy for increasing the quality of TVET research is to foster linkages with local and international research organizations like Centre for Policy Research, National Science Foundation are local such organizations and the NCVER at Australia, PCTRT of the RMIT University are such international organizations with which building linkages would be useful. Therefore, in this 5-year Strategic Plan, action will be taken to make links with these organizations which are beneficial for development of TVET research in Sri Lanka.",1,Education & Training,Vocational Education & Training,16,Research Cell,1421,https://gic.gov.lk/gic/index.php/en/component/info/?id=1421&catid=16&task=info,"Service: Research Cell

2-75-1804-1,Demand for Fine Aggregates and the Problem of River Sand Mining,"Due to the recent growth in the construction industry, the demand for fine aggregates is escalating rapidly. River sand has been the most widely used fine aggregate in Sri Lanka, and over-exploitation of river sand to meet the demand has led to various harmful consequences such as an increase in the depth of the riverbed, lowering of the water table, and salinity intrusion into the rivers. Because of these environmental problems, there is a necessity to restrict river sand mining, especially at vulnerable locations. As a remedial measure, the government imposes various restrictions on the extraction of river sand with consequent increases in prices. This has not only inconvenienced the users directly but also indirectly impacted the overall stability of the construction industry owing to concomitant increases in construction prices. 

A pilot survey revealed that individuals and state sector clients seldom approve the use of shore sand or offshore sand for concrete, let alone reinforced concrete. Further, the initial offshore sand stockpile lying in Muthurajawela is exhausted, and fresh offshore stockpiles are being formed, but they require exposure to rain. Therefore, further studies are required, looking into the suitability of offshore sand from different perspectives. Since the potential environmental damage due to offshore sand extraction is far less compared to that due to river sand extraction.

As a result of these restrictions, obtaining sand at the required quantities at required times is a major problem for those engaged in the construction industry. As a solution to this problem, our corporation has launched a project to release offshore sand to the market at a reasonable price and as a service of protection of the environment and sustainability of the construction industry.",2,"Housing, Property & Utilities",Infrastructure,75,Sales of Sea Sand,1804,https://gic.gov.lk/gic/index.php/en/component/info/?id=1804&catid=75&task=info,"Service: Sales of Sea Sand

10-61-1790-1,Background and Establishment of the Construction Guarantee Trust/Fund (CGF),"For several decades, Construction Contractors, particularly the small and medium scale Contractors were faced with a dilemma in complying with the regulations that require them to furnish Bonds and Guarantees for the purpose of Bidding and Executing Construction Contracts for both the State and Private Sector Organizations. Such a scenario was caused as Commercial Banks demand large cash margins or immovable property as Security/Collateral for providing the Construction Contractors with bonding facilities. Such margins or collateral ranged from 100-200% of the Bond value.

On representations made by the Industry in this regard, the Government in 1999 decided to set-up a Government Funded Organization to provide the required facilities to Construction Contractors against reasonable conditions. For this purpose Government allocated a grant of Rs.100.0 Million from the Budget. The secretary to the Treasury was entrusted to implement the proposal to established a trust and accordingly the declaration of trust was entered between the Secretary to the Treasury as settlor and bestowed powers to a Board of Trustees comprised from Government & Private sector for the proper execution and the Management of the Trust/Fund.

It was in this context that the Construction Guarantee Trust/Fund (CGF) was established in 1999 as an Independent Trust with autonomy. Accordingly, the Trust/Fund is presently administered by a Board of Trustees represented from the Government and Private Sectors, under the Chairmanship of the Secretary to the Ministry incharge of the subject of construction.",10,"Trade, Business & Industry","Loans, Funds & Incentive Schemes",61,Providing Bonds & Guarantees,1790,https://gic.gov.lk/gic/index.php/en/component/info/?id=1790&catid=61&task=info,"Service: Providing Bonds & Guarantees

4-27-1767-1,Applying for a Passport Through Sri Lankan Overseas Missions (Part 1),"You can apply for a passport through a Sri Lankan Overseas Mission if you are a Sri Lankan citizen residing abroad. The application process involves submitting the required documents to the respective mission, which will then forward your application to the Department of Immigration and Emigration in Sri Lanka. Once the passport is processed, it will be sent back to the mission for issuance to the applicant.

To apply, you will typically need to complete an application form, provide photographs that meet specific requirements, and submit supporting documents to prove your identity and Sri Lankan citizenship. These documents may include your birth certificate, national identity card, previous passport (if applicable), and visa or residence permit for the country you are residing in. The exact requirements may vary depending on the specific mission and your individual circumstances, so it's always best to check with the relevant mission beforehand.

The fees for passport applications submitted through overseas missions are generally higher than those submitted in Sri Lanka, reflecting the additional administrative costs involved. Payment methods may also vary, so it is essential to confirm the accepted methods of payment with the mission before submitting your application.
