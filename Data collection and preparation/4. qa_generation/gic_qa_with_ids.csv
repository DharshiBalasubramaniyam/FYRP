The Research Cell will continue work towards achievement of following three objectives.

Objective 01

To foster conducting and promotion of research related to TVET  issues.

It is observed that many researches are done in education and higher education sector. However, a very few or minimum number of researches are done in TVET sector. Therefore, it is vital to foster conducting and promotion of research related to TVET through inculcation or research culture in the TVET sector of Sri Lanka. Due to the low prominence given to research, the officers of training institutions undertake no research or engage in TVET research at low level. The research will conduct in a way that proposes recommendations for strengthening policy and planning of TVET. Therefore, it is timely to engage in TVET research activities at institute level and national level.

Objective 02

To be the key partner of facilitation for TVET research.

The Research Cell will facilitate undertaking research through dissemination of TVET information among interested parties, especially among TVET researchers. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce mechanisms to disseminate research information in the TVET sector.

Objective 03

To create beneficial linkages with local and international research Institutes.

One important strategy for increasing the quality of TVET research is to foster linkages with local and international research organizations like Centre for Policy Research, National Science Foundation are local such organizations and the NCVER at Australia, PCTRT of the RMIT University are such international organizations with which building linkages would be useful. Therefore, in this 5-year Strategic Plan, action will be taken to make links with these organizations which are beneficial for development of TVET research in Sri Lanka.",What are the primary objectives of the Research Cell for TVET Promotion?,"The Research Cell for TVET Promotion has three primary objectives: to foster conducting and promotion of research related to TVET issues, to be the key partner for facilitating TVET research through information dissemination, and to create beneficial linkages with local and international research institutes for quality improvement.",தொழிற்கல்வி மற்றும் பயிற்சி (TVET) மேம்பாட்டிற்கான ஆராய்ச்சிக் கலத்தின் முக்கிய குறிக்கோள்கள் யாவை?,"தொழிற்கல்வி மற்றும் பயிற்சி மேம்பாட்டிற்கான ஆராய்ச்சிக் கலத்தின் முக்கிய குறிக்கோள்கள் மூன்று ஆகும்: தொழிற்கல்வி மற்றும் பயிற்சி தொடர்பான ஆராய்ச்சிகளை மேற்கொள்வதையும் மேம்படுத்துவதையும் ஊக்குவித்தல், தொழிற்கல்வி மற்றும் பயிற்சி ஆராய்ச்சிக்கான வசதி வழங்குவதில் முக்கிய பங்காளியாக இருத்தல், மற்றும் உள்ளூர் மற்றும் சர்வதேச ஆராய்ச்சி நிறுவனங்களுடன் பயனுள்ள தொடர்புகளை உருவாக்குதல்.",වෘත්තීය අධ්‍යාපන හා පුහුණු (TVET) ප්‍රවර්ධනය සඳහා වන පර්යේෂණ ඒකකයේ ප්‍රධාන අරමුණු මොනවාද?,"වෘත්තීය අධ්‍යාපන හා පුහුණු ප්‍රවර්ධනය සඳහා වන පර්යේෂණ ඒකකයේ ප්‍රධාන අරමුණු තුනක් ඇත: වෘත්තීය අධ්‍යාපන හා පුහුණු ගැටළු සම්බන්ධ පර්යේෂණ පැවැත්වීම සහ ප්‍රවර්ධනය කිරීම, වෘත්තීය අධ්‍යාපන හා පුහුණු පර්යේෂණ සඳහා පහසුකම් සැපයීමේ ප්‍රධාන හවුල්කරු වීම, සහ දේශීය හා ජාත්‍යන්තර පර්යේෂණ ආයතන සමඟ ප්‍රයෝජනවත් සම්බන්ධතා ඇති කර ගැනීම.",156

Topic: Demand for Fine Aggregates and the Problem of River Sand Mining
---
Due to the recent growth in the construction industry, the demand for fine aggregates is escalating rapidly. River sand has been the most widely used fine aggregate in Sri Lanka, and over-exploitation of river sand to meet the demand has led to various harmful consequences such as an increase in the depth of the riverbed, lowering of the water table, and salinity intrusion into the rivers. Because of these environmental problems, there is a necessity to restrict river sand mining, especially at vulnerable locations. As a remedial measure, the government imposes various restrictions on the extraction of river sand with consequent increases in prices. This has not only inconvenienced the users directly but also indirectly impacted the overall stability of the construction industry owing to concomitant increases in construction prices. 

A pilot survey revealed that individuals and state sector clients seldom approve the use of shore sand or offshore sand for concrete, let alone reinforced concrete. Further, the initial offshore sand stockpile lying in Muthurajawela is exhausted, and fresh offshore stockpiles are being formed, but they require exposure to rain. Therefore, further studies are required, looking into the suitability of offshore sand from different perspectives. Since the potential environmental damage due to offshore sand extraction is far less compared to that due to river sand extraction.

As a result of these restrictions, obtaining sand at the required quantities at required times is a major problem for those engaged in the construction industry. As a solution to this problem, our corporation has launched a project to release offshore sand to the market at a reasonable price and as a service of protection of the environment and sustainability of the construction industry.","What environmental and economic problems have arisen in Sri Lanka due to the escalating demand for fine aggregates, and how does the corporation's 'Sales of Sea Sand' service provide a solution?","The escalating demand for fine aggregates in Sri Lanka has led to over-exploitation of river sand, causing environmental issues such as increased riverbed depth, lowered water tables, and salinity intrusion.

As a solution, the corporation has launched a project under its 'Sales of Sea Sand' service to release offshore sand to the market at a reasonable price, aiming to protect the environment and ensure the sustainability of the construction industry.","இலங்கையில் நுண்ணிய மொத்தப் பொருட்களுக்கான அதிகரித்து வரும் தேவையால் என்ன சுற்றுச்சூழல் மற்றும் பொருளாதாரப் பிரச்சனைகள் எழுந்துள்ளன, மேலும் கூட்டுத்தாபனத்தின் 'கடல் மணல் விற்பனை' சேவை எவ்வாறு ஒரு தீர்வை வழங்குகிறது?","இலங்கையில் நுண்ணிய மொத்தப் பொருட்களுக்கான அதிகரித்து வரும் தேவை ஆற்று மணலின் அதிகப்படியான சுரண்டலுக்கு வழிவகுத்தது, இது ஆற்றுப் படுக்கை ஆழமடைதல், நீர் மட்டம் குறைதல் மற்றும் ஆறுகளில் உப்புத்தன்மை ஊடுருவல் போன்ற சுற்றுச்சூழல் பிரச்சினைகளை ஏற்படுத்தியது. இதன் விளைவாக அரசாங்க கட்டுப்பாடுகள், ஆற்று மணல் விலை உயர்வுகள் மற்றும் கட்டுமானத் துறையின் நிலைத்தன்மைக்கு எதிர்மறையான தாக்கங்கள் ஏற்பட்டன. இதற்கு ஒரு தீர்வாக, கூட்டுத்தாபனம் தனது 'கடல் மணல் விற்பனை' சேவையின் கீழ், சுற்றுச்சூழல் பாதுகாப்பையும் கட்டுமானத் துறையின் நிலைத்தன்மையையும் உறுதி செய்வதற்காக, நியாயமான விலையில் கடல்சார் மணலை சந்தைக்கு விடுவிக்கும் ஒரு திட்டத்தை தொடங்கியுள்ளது.","සියුම් එකතු කිරීම් සඳහා ඇති ඉල්ලුම ඉහළ යාම හේතුවෙන් ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ ඇති වී ඇති පාරිසරික හා ආර්ථික ගැටලු මොනවාද, එමෙන්ම සංස්ථාවේ 'මුහුදු වැලි අලෙවිය' සේවාව මගින් ඊට විසඳුම් සපයන්නේ කෙසේද?","ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ සියුම් එකතු කිරීම් සඳහා ඇති ඉල්ලුම ඉහළ යාම ගංගා වැලි අධික ලෙස සූරාකෑමට හේතු වී ඇති අතර, එය ගංගා පත්ල ගැඹුරු වීම, ජල මට්ටම පහත වැටීම සහ ගංගාවලට ලවණ ජලය ඇතුළු වීම වැනි පාරිසරික ගැටලු ඇති කර තිබේ. මෙහි ප්‍රතිඵලයක් ලෙස රජයේ සීමා කිරීම්, ගංගා වැලි සඳහා ඉහළ මිල ගණන් සහ ඉදිකිරීම් කර්මාන්තයේ ස්ථාවරත්වයට අහිතකර බලපෑම් ඇති විය. මෙම ගැටලුවට විසඳුමක් ලෙස, සංස්ථාව සිය 'මුහුදු වැලි අලෙවිය' සේවාව යටතේ පරිසරය ආරක්ෂා කිරීමට සහ ඉදිකිරීම් කර්මාන්තයේ තිරසාරත්වය සහතික කිරීමට අරමුණු කරමින්, සාධාරණ මිලකට මුහුදු වැලි වෙළඳපොළට නිකුත් කිරීමේ ව්‍යාපෘතියක් දියත් කර ඇත.",285

Otherwise it must be stamped by the Measurement Units, Standards and Services Department Step 2: The Department will inform the requester via mail or phone the time, date and location where the Inspectors will test the quality of the measuring equipment Step 3: The applicant arrives at the specified venue with the measuring instrument Step 4: The Inspector examines and verifies the instrument Step 5: If the instrument meets the requirements, the Department stamps the instrument and a certificate is issued to the party concerned. Note: During stamping if an inspector finds a particular instrument does not meet the requirements, the retailer/manufacturer is directed to a Technical Officer to make required adjustments to the instrument. If minor amendments need to be made, the Retailer/Manufacture can get it fixed and get it inspected again at that time. If it’s a major amendment it cannot be fixed on the spot. The Retailer/Manufacture will have to get it fixed by an authorized person / agency.

Topic: Background and Establishment of the Construction Guarantee Trust/Fund (CGF)
---
For several decades, Construction Contractors, particularly the small and medium scale Contractors were faced with a dilemma in complying with the regulations that require them to furnish Bonds and Guarantees for the purpose of Bidding and Executing Construction Contracts for both the State and Private Sector Organizations. Such a scenario was caused as Commercial Banks demand large cash margins or immovable property as Security/Collateral for providing the Construction Contractors with bonding facilities. Such margins or collateral ranged from 100-200% of the Bond value.

On representations made by the Industry in this regard, the Government in 1999 decided to set-up a Government Funded Organization to provide the required facilities to Construction Contractors against reasonable conditions. For this purpose Government allocated a grant of Rs.100.0 Million from the Budget. The secretary to the Treasury was entrusted to implement the proposal to established a trust and accordingly the declaration of trust was entered between the Secretary to the Treasury as settlor and bestowed powers to a Board of Trustees comprised from Government & Private sector for the proper execution and the Management of the Trust/Fund.

It was in this context that the Construction Guarantee Trust/Fund (CGF) was established in 1999 as an Independent Trust with autonomy. Accordingly, the Trust/Fund is presently administered by a Board of Trustees represented from the Government and Private Sectors, under the Chairmanship of the Secretary to the Ministry incharge of the subject of construction.","Why was the Construction Guarantee Trust/Fund (CGF) established, and when?","The Construction Guarantee Trust/Fund (CGF) was established in 1999 by the Government to provide bonding facilities to Construction Contractors against reasonable conditions, as commercial banks demanded large cash margins or immovable property as security.",கட்டுமான உத்தரவாத அறக்கட்டளை/நிதி (CGF) ஏன் மற்றும் எப்போது நிறுவப்பட்டது?,"வணிக வங்கிகள் கட்டுமான ஒப்பந்தக்காரர்களிடமிருந்து பெரிய ரொக்கப் பண வரம்புகள் அல்லது அசையாச் சொத்துக்களைப் பாதுகாப்பாகக் கோரியதால், கட்டுமான ஒப்பந்தக்காரர்களுக்கு நியாயமான நிபந்தனைகளின் கீழ் பிணைப்பு வசதிகளை வழங்குவதற்காக, அரசாங்கத்தால் 1999 இல் கட்டுமான உத்தரவாத அறக்கட்டளை/நிதி (CGF) நிறுவப்பட்டது.",ඉදිකිරීම් ඇපකර භාරය/අරමුදල (CGF) පිහිටුවනු ලැබුවේ ඇයි සහ කවදාද?,"වාණිජ බැංකු ඉදිකිරීම් කොන්ත්‍රාත්කරුවන්ගෙන් විශාල මුදල් ආන්තික හෝ නිශ්චල දේපල ඇපකරයක් ලෙස ඉල්ලා සිටි බැවින්, සාධාරණ කොන්දේසි යටතේ බැඳීම් පහසුකම් සැපයීම සඳහා රජය විසින් 1999 දී ඉදිකිරීම් ඇපකර භාරය/අරමුදල (CGF) පිහිටුවන ලදී.",463

Topic: National Engineering Standards and Formulation Policy

The National Engineering Standards formulated by the Engineering Standardization Division are developed through a committee process and a consultative process with the voluntary involvement and the co-operative effort of all interested parties representing consumers, producers, users, public Institutions and independent technical Organizations. The Institution appoints Technical Committees to advice and guide the Institution in these activities, with the aim of gathering all possible expertise in the best possible way to maximize benefits to the national economy from these Standardization activities. National standards represent co-ordinated solutions for use in technology, commerce trade and administration and are intended to achieve; 

These standards may be specifications for materials or products; they may be codes of practice written in mandatory form or guides giving recommended practices in some field of industry; or they many be methods of test, glossaries of terms or may express some other form of standardization.

In the formulation of Standards, the policy of the Sri Lanka Standards Institution is to be in line with the International Standards and practices as far as practicable. To this effect International Standards are adopted, as Sri Lanka Standards, wherever feasible.

In the selection of Standards formulation projects priority is given to standards that facilitate internal and external trade and to enhance the international competitiveness of Sri Lankan products with the prime objective of safeguarding the interest of the consumer. There are now around 1400 Sri Lanka Standards relating to products, commodities, materials, processes & practices.

Topic: Applying for a Passport Through Sri Lankan Overseas Missions (Part 1)
---
You can apply for a passport through a Sri Lankan Overseas Mission if you are a Sri Lankan citizen residing abroad. The application process involves submitting the required documents to the respective mission, which will then forward your application to the Department of Immigration and Emigration in Sri Lanka. Once the passport is processed, it will be sent back to the mission for issuance to the applicant.

To apply, you will typically need to complete an application form, provide photographs that meet specific requirements, and submit supporting documents to prove your identity and Sri Lankan citizenship. These documents may include your birth certificate, national identity card, previous passport (if applicable), and visa or residence permit for the country you are residing in. The exact requirements may vary depending on the specific mission and your individual circumstances, so it's always best to check with the relevant mission beforehand.

The fees for passport applications submitted through overseas missions are generally higher than those submitted in Sri Lanka, reflecting the additional administrative costs involved. Payment methods may also vary, so it is essential to confirm the accepted methods of payment with the mission before submitting your application.
",Who is eligible to apply for a Sri Lankan passport through an Overseas Mission and what is the general application process?,"Sri Lankan citizens residing abroad are eligible to apply for a passport through an Overseas Mission.
