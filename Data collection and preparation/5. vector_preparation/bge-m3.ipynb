Infrastructure Facilities Development Programme, targeting the completion of 12240 Projects island-wide. ii. Special Development Programme, aiming to complete 550 Projects, implemented in selected Districts based on their proposals. iii. Special Gammana Development Programme, with the primary objective of developing selected Grama Niladari Divisions from the 3060 divisions, in every aspect, as model projects. iv. Gampubudu Revolving Fund, targeting the implementation of 10598 Projects. To date, 164.6 Mn has been recovered island-wide. This fund is utilized to implement Livelihood Projects, with 50% of the Samurdhi Authority\\u2019s contribution being recovered.\\n\\nUnder the Infrastructure Facilities Development Programme, several tasks are performed. These include: Concreting Rural Roads & flight of steps, Projects of Irrigation Cannels, Tanks and Lakes, Mini Hydropower Plants, Drinking water & common water supply, Minor Bridges & Culverts, and Projects of Environment Protection. These projects reach villages after the identification of their necessities and after obtaining approvals through Janasaba. Subsequently, the recommendations of the Divisional Secretary & District Secretary are forwarded to the Samurdhi Authority. The system of implementing the projects is carried out under the Samurdhi Development programme in the Divisional Secretariat. A minimum of 20% community participation is required, and construction under a contract system is prohibited.
