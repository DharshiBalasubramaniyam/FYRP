Off-shore Sand Pumping & Selling

Due to the recent growth in the construction   industry,� the demand for fine aggregates is escalating rapidly. River sand has been the most widely used fine aggregates in Sri Lanka and over-exploitation of river sand to meet the demand has led to various harmful consequences such as increase in the depth of the river bed, lowering of the water table, and salinity intrusion into the rivers. Because of these environmental problems, there is a necessity to restrict river sand mining especially at vulnerable locations. As a remedial measure, the government imposes various restrictions on the extraction of river sand with consequent increases in prices. Not only has this inconvenienced the users directly, but also indirectly impacted on the overall stability of the construction industry owing to concomitant increases in construction prices. � � � � � � � � � |

 | A pilot survey revealed that individuals and   state sector clients seldom approve the use of shore sand or offshore sand for concrete let alone reinforced concrete. Further, the initial offshore sand stockpile lying in Muthurajawela is exhausted and fresh offshore stockpiles are being formed, but they require exposure to rain. Therefore, further studies are required looking into the suitability of offshore sand from different perspectives. Since the potential environmental damage due to offshore sand extraction is far less compared to that due to river sand extraction.
As a result of these restrictions, obtaining   sand at the required quantities at required times, is a major problem for those engaged in the construction industry. As a solution to this problem our corporation has launched a project to release offshore sand to the market with the reasonable price and as a service of protection of envirenment and sustainability of construction industry. � � � � |
