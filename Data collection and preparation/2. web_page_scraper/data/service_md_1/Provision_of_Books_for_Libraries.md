If books on the subject of Ayurveda are required for libraries maintained at a temple, school, Damma school or any other public place, a written request should be made to the commissioner of Ayurveda for this purpose. Such request should be made either on a letter head of any society or voluntary organization or on a letter with rubber seal.
