The National Engineering Standards formulated by the Engineering Standardization Division are developed through a committee process and a consultative process with the voluntary involvement and the co-operative effort of all interested parties representing consumers, producers, users, public Institutions and independent technical Organizations. The Institution appoints Technical Committees to advice and guide the Institution in these activities, with the aim of gathering all possible expertise in the best possible way to maximize benefits to the national economy from these Standardization activities. National standards represent co-ordinated solutions for use in technology, commerce trade and administration and are intended to achieve;

These standards may be specifications for materials or products; they may be codes of practice written in mandatory form or guides giving recommended practices in some field of industry; or they many be methods of test, glossaries of terms or may express some other form of standardization.

In the formulation of Standards, the policy of the Sri Lanka Standards Institution is to be in line with the International Standards and practices as far as practicable. To this effect International Standards are adopted, as Sri Lanka Standards, wherever feasible.

In the selection of Standards formulation projects priority is given to standards that facilitate internal and external trade and to enhance the international competitiveness of Sri Lankan products with the prime objective of safeguarding the interest of the consumer. There are now around 1400 Sri Lanka Standards relating to products, commodities, materials, processes & practices. Many have been revised to take care of the developments in the new materials, processes and technologies. Such revisions are indicated with the year of revision. Sri Lanka Standards are intended for voluntary adoption by those concerned unless made compulsory under the provisions of the Sri Lanka Standards Institution Act or by specific reference to standards in other acts and regulations.

SECTORAL COMMITTEES

The Council of the SLSI appoints Sectoral Committees covering broad subject areas to advise the SLSI on [standards formulation](https://gic.gov.lk/gic/index.php/en/component/info/?id=0&task=info&back=0&pid=1528) and implementation activities. Sectoral Committees presently in operation are given below.

ELECTRICAL & ELECTRONICS ENGINEERING SECTION

- Sectoral Committee on Electronic Engineering
- Sectoral Committee on Electrical Appliances and Accessories
- Sectoral Committee on Electric Cables and Conductors
- National Electrotechnical Committee of Sri Lanka
- Sectoral Committee on Information Technology
- Working Group on Electrical Appliances and Accessories.
- Working Group on Electric Motors
- Working Group on Lightning Protection System

MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SECTION

- Sectoral Committee on Materials Mechanical Systems and Manufacturing Engineering
- Technical Advisory Committee on Lubricant Industry
- Working Group on Chain link fence fabric/ Structural Steel
- Working Group on Plastics
- Working Group on Aluminium Extrusions
- Working Group on Galvanized steel pipes and fittings
- Working Group on Steel

CIVIL ENGINEERING SECTION

- Sectoral Committee on Building and Construction Materials
- Working Group on Compressed Stabilized Earth Block
- Working Group on Revision of Septic tank standard (Part 2)
- Working Group on Revision of cement Standards
- Technical Advisory Committee on Code of practice for design and construction of biogas systems
- Working Group on Specification for Tile Grout and Adhesives
- Specification for fine aggregate for concrete and mortar
- Working Group on national annexure for euro codes
- Working Group on Specification for cationic emulsified asphalts
- Working Group on Concrete Paving Blocks

Sectoral Committees are formed from experts in the respective areas drawn from manufacturers, consumers, independent research and testing organizations, and individual experts. Thus a Sectoral Committee constitutes of both members nominated from respective organizations as well as members appointed on a personal capacity.

SLSI in consultation with Sectoral Committees may appoint Working Groups to deal with specific standardization projects. Such Working Groups report to the relevant Sectoral Committee.

Chairpersons of the Sectoral Committees are appointed by the Council of the SLSI. These committees meet about once in two months or more often as necessary. Meetings of a committee are normally open only to members of the committee. Requests for attendance by visitors for special purposes should be directed in the first instance to SLSI which will issue and invitation in consultation with the Chairman of the Sectoral Committee.

Each standardization project is managed by a Standards Engineer of the Engineering Standerdization Division of the SLSI. There are several alternate procedures which are adopted based on the nature and complexity of the subject; availability of data, reference documents, other relevant standards, and information. The alternative procedures which are followed are indicated in a [flow chart](https://gic.gov.lk/gic/pdf/flow chart.pdf) .
