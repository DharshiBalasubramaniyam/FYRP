Mobile medical clinics are conducted in special instances such as in the event of spread of epidemic disease or displacement as a result of natural disaster. A written request should be made to the commissioner of Ayurveda for this purpose. Such request should be made on a letter head of any society or voluntary organization or on a letter with rubber seal.
