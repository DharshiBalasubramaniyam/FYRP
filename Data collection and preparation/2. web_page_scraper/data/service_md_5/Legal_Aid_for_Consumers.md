Consumer Protection Desk

The consumer protection activities have now emerged as a major public services component in the society. With the enactment of the Consumer Affairs Law No.9 of 2003 and the appointment of the Consumer Affairs Authority, the general awareness of the consumer rights has become important for the benefit of the general public.

The UN principles on consumer protection form the basis of the consumer law in Sri Lanka whereby not only the consumers but also the integrity of manufacturers, traders and service providers are also protected.

The Consumer Protection Desk of the Legal Aid Commission liaises closely with the Consumer Affairs Authority and conduct awareness programs through the 34 Legal Aid Centers islandwide. The target groups for the awareness programs are 6,500 Elders’ Societies, 14,200 Grama Niladharies and 100 Law Circles in schools in different provinces.

The Head of the Consumer Protection Desk is Lasanthi Palapaththwela, Attorney-at-Law who coordinates with the Consumer Affairs Authority and conduct awareness programs. She is also responsible for advising consumers who are victimized by traders in violation of the Consumer Affairs Law and seek redress from the Authority.
